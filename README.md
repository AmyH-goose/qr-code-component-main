## Overview
This is my first html/css project that I did outside of a tutorial or classroom and my first time using git.

## My process
I downloaded the figma file and first sorted out the HTML aspect of the project (deciding what's an h1, what's a paragraph, etc.). Then I used the figma file's design system to set different classes for the different properties of each element (for example, font color) and applied the class to the HTML element. For the other properties like width and border-radius for the qr-card, I styled it directly in CSS. 

### What I learned

I learned how to use box-shadows which is typically written like this: box-shadow: x-value y-value blur-radius color. I realized that it's better to use rgba values instead of hex because it's easier to change the opacity when needed.

### Continued development

I realized while doing this project that I didn't know where to start. There were so many things that I needed to do that I got overwhelmed with too much information so I want to continue to try and work out and refine a work process. I also didn't know how to use responsive css. I realize that the website is very static but I don't know where to start to make it more responsive.
